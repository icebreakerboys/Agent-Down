# Agent-Down
Welcome to our 2D SkyDiving Game!

Feel free to clone the game directly to your computer to play or contribute.
Currently the game build is closely tied to the Intellij IDE, so you might have to do some work arounds to get it compiling on your own machine
Alternatively, you can visit https://icebreakerboys.github.io/Agent-Down-Website/ to download the executables or jar file if youre interested in solely giving the game a try.

Thanks for checking us out!
